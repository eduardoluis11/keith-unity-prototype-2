Thanks. That worked for a generic 3D cube. I can rotate a generic 3D cube with my mouse if I attach that script that you generated for me. Well, I created a new 3D model of a book in blender, and exported as a FXB file. I was able to import it in Unity. However, if I attach that script that you gave me to my book made in blender, I can't rotate the book. Why is this happening, and how can I make the 3D book made in blender to rotate when I click and drag the mouse on it?


The issue you're encountering where the 3D model of the book isn't rotating like the cube likely stems from one of the following reasons:

1. **Collider Issue**: Your 3D model may not have a collider, or it may have a misconfigured collider, which means the `Raycast` in the script isn't detecting mouse clicks on the book. The cube you used earlier likely had a collider by default.

2. **Mesh Import Settings**: When you import models from Blender (FBX files), sometimes their import settings might not include a collider, or the scale/rotation might be incorrect, causing issues when trying to interact with them.

### Solution

#### Step 1: Add or Fix the Collider on Your 3D Book Model
To make the `Raycast` detect your book, it needs a **collider**. If the model imported from Blender doesn't have a collider, Unity won’t register mouse clicks on it.

- **Add a Collider**: If your book doesn't have a collider, add one by following these steps:
  1. Select your book in the **Hierarchy**.
  2. In the **Inspector**, click `Add Component`.
  3. Search for and add a **Mesh Collider** (if your book's shape is complex) or a **Box Collider** (for a simpler approximation).

- **Adjust the Collider**: If the collider is misaligned or scaled wrong, you can adjust it manually in the Inspector or tweak the import settings for the FBX model.

#### Step 2: Check Model's Import Settings
Sometimes, Blender exports models with unexpected rotations or scales, especially if the Blender model's transform settings (like scaling or rotation) weren't applied correctly before exporting.

- **Reset Transform in Blender**:
  - Open your book model in Blender.
  - Select the object, and press `Ctrl + A` and select `All Transforms` to apply all transforms (location, rotation, scale).
  - Re-export the model as an FBX and re-import it into Unity.

- **Check Scale in Unity**:
  1. Select the book's model in the **Project** window.
  2. In the **Inspector**, look for the **Model** tab and ensure the **Scale Factor** is set correctly (usually `1`).
  3. Also ensure that the **Mesh Compression** isn't set too high (set it to **Off** for testing purposes).

#### Step 3: Ensure the Raycast is Hitting the Book
Your script uses a `Raycast` to detect if the book is clicked. The collider must be properly attached to the book for this to work. Also, ensure that the `Raycast` is detecting the book by adding some debugging to your code.

You can update the script like this to confirm the Raycast is hitting the book:

```csharp
void Update()
{
    // Check if the left mouse button is pressed down
    if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
    {
        // Check if the click is on the book using a Raycast
        RaycastHit hit;
        Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
        if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit))
        {
            Debug.Log("Raycast hit: " + hit.transform.name);  // Add this line for debugging

            if (hit.transform == transform)
            {
                isDragging = true;
                lastMousePosition = Input.mousePosition;
            }
        }
    }

    // Other parts of the script...
}
```

- **Debugging**: When you click on the book, check the Unity **Console** to see if the name of the object being hit by the Raycast is logged. If it logs the correct object name (your book's GameObject name), you know the Raycast is hitting the right object.

#### Step 4: Test and Adjust the Book's Pivot Point
In Blender, make sure that the **pivot point** of your book model is centered appropriately. Sometimes, models imported from Blender might have a pivot point far off from the center, which can cause weird rotations.

- If the book rotates incorrectly, you may need to adjust the pivot point in Blender:
  1. In Blender, select the book model.
  2. Move the 3D cursor to the center of the book.
  3. In `Object Mode`, go to `Object > Set Origin > Origin to 3D Cursor`.
  4. Re-export the model and re-import it into Unity.

### Summary

- **Add or Adjust the Collider**: Ensure your 3D book model has a proper collider (e.g., a Mesh Collider).
- **Check Model Import Settings**: Make sure your model is correctly scaled and rotated after import from Blender.
- **Verify the Raycast Hit**: Use the `Debug.Log()` to ensure the mouse click is detected on the 3D book.
- **Pivot Point**: If the book rotates awkwardly, check the pivot point in Blender and ensure it's positioned correctly.

After these steps, the script you attached should work with your 3D book model, allowing it to rotate on mouse drag.

Thanks, but now I have another issue. The 3D book is comprised of a 3D cube and mutliple instances of text. The entire game FBX 3D model is called "Atlash Shrugged". If I add the collider and the rotating script to the FBX Game Object, it won't do anything. However, if I go to the "cube" game object, which is a sub-game object within the "Atlas Shrugged" FBX model, and then attach the box collider and the rotating script to the book cube, I will be able to successfully rotate the 3D model of the book. However, the text in the book won't rotate alongside the cube game object. So, this creates a bug in which the text from the front and back cover of the book is left floating around. How can I make the text to properly rotate alongside the 3D cube when I rotate the book? Look at the attached image so that you can see the bug that's currently occuring.



It looks like the issue is that the text objects within your "Atlas Shrugged" model are not children of the rotating cube GameObject. When you apply the rotation script only to the cube, it affects only that cube, and the other components (like the text) are not being rotated because they are separate objects.

### Solution: Make the Text Objects Children of the Cube

To ensure that both the cube and the text objects rotate together, you need to make sure that the text objects are children of the cube. This way, when you rotate the cube, the entire hierarchy (including the text objects) will rotate as well.

#### Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. **Make the Text Objects Children of the Cube**:
    - In the **Hierarchy** window, drag the text objects (like the "Atlas Shrugged" text) under the cube object within the "Atlas Shrugged" FBX model.
    - This will make the text objects children of the cube.

    When you rotate the cube, any children of that cube (in this case, the text objects) will also rotate with it, preventing them from "floating" independently.

2. **Test the Rotation**:
    - Now that the text objects are children of the cube, when you click and drag to rotate, the entire book (including the text) should rotate correctly together.

#### Alternative Solution (Group the Objects):

If your book is made up of multiple components and you'd prefer not to parent them manually, you could group all the relevant parts (the cube and the text) into an empty parent GameObject.

1. **Create an Empty GameObject**:
    - In the **Hierarchy**, right-click and select `Create Empty`.
    - Name this new GameObject something like "BookContainer" or "Atlas Shrugged Group".

2. **Make All Objects Children of the Empty GameObject**:
    - Drag the cube and all the text objects (or any other related parts) under this new empty GameObject.

3. **Attach the Script to the Parent GameObject**:
    - Attach the **Drag To Rotate** script and the **Collider** to the empty GameObject instead of directly on the cube.

4. **Test**:
    - Now, rotating the empty parent GameObject will rotate everything inside it together, keeping the cube and the text aligned.

### Summary

To fix the issue where the text is floating separately from the cube, you need to either:

- **Make the text objects children of the cube** so that they inherit the cube's rotation, or
- **Group the cube and text objects** into an empty GameObject and apply the rotation script to the parent object.

After doing this, the entire book (cube and text) should rotate properly when you click and drag.

Is there any way to export the entire 3D model as a single unity in Blender, so that the text is part of the cube of the 3D model in the exported FXB file?



Yes, you can export the entire 3D model from Blender as a single unit, including the text, so that it functions as a unified object when imported into Unity. Here's how you can do that:

### 1. **Convert Text to Mesh in Blender**
In Blender, text objects are separate from mesh objects like cubes. If you want the text to be part of the same object as the cube, you need to convert the text to a mesh. After converting, you can join it with the cube into a single object before exporting.

#### Steps to Convert Text to Mesh:
1. **Select the Text Object**:
    - In **Object Mode**, select the text object(s) that you want to include with the cube.

2. **Convert the Text to Mesh**:
    - With the text selected, press `Alt + C` or right-click and choose `Convert To → Mesh from Curve/Meta/Surf/Text`.
    - This will convert the text object into a mesh, which can now be manipulated and combined with other mesh objects.

### 2. **Join the Text and Cube Mesh**
Once the text is converted into a mesh, you can merge it with the cube, so they act as a single object in Blender.

#### Steps to Join the Objects:
1. **Select the Cube and Text Meshes**:
    - In **Object Mode**, hold `Shift` and click to select both the cube and the converted text mesh.

2. **Join the Objects**:
    - Press `Ctrl + J` or right-click and choose `Join`. This will merge the selected objects into a single mesh.
    - Now the text and the cube are part of the same object.

### 3. **Check the Origin Point and Pivot**
After joining, it's a good idea to check that the **origin point** (pivot) of the newly combined object is correctly positioned. This will affect how it rotates in Unity.

#### Set the Origin:
1. **Set the 3D Cursor to the Desired Location**:
    - If you want the pivot at a specific point (like the center of the cube), you can select the cube and press `Shift + S`, then choose `Cursor to Selected`.

2. **Set the Origin to the 3D Cursor**:
    - Select the combined object (text + cube), then press `Right-click → Set Origin → Origin to 3D Cursor`.

### 4. **Export the Model as FBX**
Once the text and cube are joined into a single object, you can export it as an FBX file and import it into Unity.

#### Steps to Export as FBX:
1. **Select the Combined Object**:
    - In **Object Mode**, select the object that contains both the text and the cube.

2. **Export the FBX**:
    - Go to `File → Export → FBX (.fbx)`.
    - In the export dialog:
        - Choose **Selected Objects** if you only want to export the combined object.
        - Ensure **Mesh** is selected under the "Object Types" options.

3. **Import into Unity**:
    - Import the exported FBX file into Unity as usual by dragging it into the **Assets** folder.

### 5. **Add Collider and Rotation Script in Unity**
Now that the text and the cube are a single object, you can apply the **Box Collider** and the **Drag to Rotate** script directly to the imported 3D model. This will ensure that the entire book, including the text, rotates properly when interacted with.

### Summary
By converting the text to a mesh, joining it with the cube, and then exporting the combined model as an FBX, you create a single object that can be rotated as one unit in Unity. This approach keeps the text and cube together in both Blender and Unity, solving the issue of floating text.
