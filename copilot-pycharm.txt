Modify this snippet so that, instead of removing the item from the inventory, it changes the position of the item to the position (1000, 1000, 1000).


**Plan:**
1. Modify the `RemoveFromInventory` method to change the item's position to (1000, 1000, 1000) instead of removing it from the inventory.
2. Ensure the item has a reference to its `Transform` to change its position.

```csharp
public void RemoveFromInventory()
{
    // Assuming the item has a reference to its Transform
    Transform itemTransform = this.transform;
    itemTransform.position = new Vector3(1000, 1000, 1000);
}
```
