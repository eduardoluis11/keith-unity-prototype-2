Modify this snippet so that, instead of removing the item from the inventory, it changes the position of the item to the position (1000, 1000, 1000).


**Plan:**
1. Modify the `RemoveFromInventory` method to change the item's position to (1000, 1000, 1000) instead of removing it from the inventory.
2. Ensure the item has a reference to its `Transform` to change its position.

```csharp
public void RemoveFromInventory()
{
    // Assuming the item has a reference to its Transform
    Transform itemTransform = this.transform;
    itemTransform.position = new Vector3(1000, 1000, 1000);
}
```

Modify this snippet from this c# script in my unity game so that, instead of detecting a SkinnedMeshRenderer Game Object, it should detect a 3D Game Object. If it's impossible to put a 3D Game Object, make it so that it detects prefab Game Objects.

**Plan:**
1. Modify the `Equipment` class to detect a 3D Game Object or a prefab Game Object instead of a `SkinnedMeshRenderer`.

```csharp
public GameObject gameObject3D;
```

**Complete fixed version of `Equipment.cs`**

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

/* Script for handling equipment items.

This will make it so that, if I click on an item in my inventory, it will be equipped to the player, and removed from the
inventory UI.

I WILL MODIFY THIS CODE SO THAT, once I click on an item, that item will be rendered at the position (1000, 1000, 1000).
